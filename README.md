**Project Description Overview:** Clothing Firm Interactive Dashboard: This project involved analyzing customer review data from a clothing firm to uncover insights into product performance, fit preferences, and customer satisfaction. The dashboard is designed to provide a comprehensive and interactive overview of key customer feedback metrics. It enables stakeholders to easily monitor and evaluate how different products are perceived across various customer segments and time periods.

**Objective:** To equip stakeholders with actionable insights into how verified purchasers rate and recommend clothing products, with the goal of improving product design, marketing strategies, and inventory planning.

**Key Features Included in the Dashboard:** 
Verified Purchaser Overall Rating
A pie chart showing average product ratings across different verification languages (e.g., Ja, Oui, Sí), offering a high-level view of customer sentiment.
Product Recommendation and Rating
Horizontal bar charts indicating the number of recommendations ("Yes"/"No") alongside average ratings for various customer groups.
Verified Purchaser Preference
Visual breakdown of customer fit perceptions (e.g., Ample, Normal, Looser) segmented by verification group.
Product Average Rating
Line chart showcasing how individual clothing products are rated, helping identify bestsellers and products needing improvement.
Average Fit by Category
Bar chart showing how fit ratings differ across categories such as Women, Men, Damen, and Private Store.

**Interactive Slicers and Filters**
The dashboard includes dynamic slicers and filters for user-driven exploration:
Product: Focus on specific products for detailed performance analysis.
Fit Rating: Explore data based on how well customers think the products fit.
Verified Language: View feedback from customers using different language options (Yes, Ja, Oui, etc.).
Category: Analyze performance across gender and store-specific categories.
Overall Rating: Filter by specific star ratings to study high or low-rated feedback.
Submission Date: Analyze trends over specific months using the interactive timeline.
 
**Key findings:**
The goal was to surface patterns and insights that inform strategic decisions in product design, marketing, and supply chain management. The key findings from the analysis are stated below:
1. Consistently High Customer Satisfaction:
The overall rating from verified purchasers across different languages (Yes, Ja, Oui, etc.) ranged between 4.0 and 4.7, indicating generally high satisfaction levels.
The highest average rating (4.7) was observed from "Sí" users, while the lowest (4.0) came from "Sim" users.
2. Strong Product Recommendations:
Customers were overwhelmingly likely to recommend products, with the "Yes" responses significantly outpacing the "No" responses in all categories.
Average product ratings where customers answered “Yes” were consistently near 4.5–5.0, reinforcing product quality perception.
3. Fit Perception Varies by User Segment:
Preferences like "Normal", "Ample", and "Looser" dominated fit feedback.
"Mais justo" (more fitted) and "Ancho" (wide) also appeared notably across some segments.
Insights suggest the need to regionalize or personalize fit specifications based on customer feedback clusters.
4. Top-Performing Products Identified:
Products such as “Classic Cotton,” “Curve Suede,” and “Corinne Suede” received perfect 5.0 ratings, signaling strong customer approval.
Lower-rated products can be reviewed for potential improvements in quality or sizing accuracy.
5. Category-Specific Fit Insights:
The “Private Store” category recorded the highest average fit rating (~3.3), suggesting better sizing satisfaction in this group.
“Damen” category showed the lowest average fit rating (~2.9), highlighting an area for product refinement.
6. Review Activity Over Time:
The time slicer shows submission activity across June to October 2024, enabling seasonal trend analysis and campaign performance tracking.
Summary:
This dashboard empowered stakeholders to interactively explore insights across dimensions such as product, region, fit preference, and time, offering an efficient decision-support system. It bridges the gap between raw customer feedback and actionable business intelligence.

# Project 3

**Title:**
Employee Data Interogation and Manipulation

**SQL Code:**
[Employee SQL code](https://github.com/Osiwi/github.io/blob/main/Employee.SQL)

**SQL Skills Used:**
Data Retrieval (SELECT): Queried and extracted specific information from the database.
Data Aggregation (SUM, COUNT): Calculated totals, such as sales and quantities, and counted records to analyze data trends.
Data Filtering (WHERE, BETWEEN, IN, AND): Applied filters to select relevant data, including filtering by ranges and lists.
Data Source Specification (FROM): Specified the tables used as data sources for retrieval
 
**Project Description:**
This project focuses on the analysis of a comprehensive dataset containing detailed information about approximately 11,000 football players. The primary objective is to utilize SQL for extracting meaningful insights regarding player demographics, performance metrics, and other relevant attributes.
Database Design and Implementation: Develop a relational database schema to effectively store and manage the football players' data, ensuring normalization and referential integrity.
Data Analysis Using SQL: Execute SQL queries to analyze various aspects of the dataset, including: Player demographics (e.g., age, nationality). Performance metrics (e.g., ratings, positions). Financial attributes (e.g., wages, market value).
Insight Extraction: Identify patterns and trends within the data, such as: Nationalities with the highest representation among players. Correlation between player attributes and performance metrics. Distribution of players across different clubs and leagues.
Reporting and Visualization: Present the findings through comprehensive reports and visualizations to facilitate better understanding and decision-making. By the end of this project, we aim to have a fully functional SQL database capable of providing in-depth analysis of football players' data, offering valuable insights for stakeholders such as team managers, scouts, and analysts

**Technology used:**
