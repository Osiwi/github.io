# Project 2

**Title:**
Employee Data Interogation and Manipulation

**SQL Code:**
[Employee SQL code](https://github.com/Osiwi/github.io/blob/main/Employee.SQL)

**SQL Skills Used:**
Data Retrieval (SELECT): Queried and extracted specific information from the database.
Data Aggregation (SUM, COUNT): Calculated totals, such as sales and quantities, and counted records to analyze data trends.
Data Filtering (WHERE, BETWEEN, IN, AND): Applied filters to select relevant data, including filtering by ranges and lists.
Data Source Specification (FROM): Specified the tables used as data sources for retrieval
 
**Project Description:**
This project focuses on the analysis of a comprehensive dataset containing detailed information about approximately 11,000 football players. The primary objective is to utilize SQL for extracting meaningful insights regarding player demographics, performance metrics, and other relevant attributes.
Database Design and Implementation: Develop a relational database schema to effectively store and manage the football players' data, ensuring normalization and referential integrity.
Data Analysis Using SQL: Execute SQL queries to analyze various aspects of the dataset, including: Player demographics (e.g., age, nationality). Performance metrics (e.g., ratings, positions). Financial attributes (e.g., wages, market value).
Insight Extraction: Identify patterns and trends within the data, such as: Nationalities with the highest representation among players. Correlation between player attributes and performance metrics. Distribution of players across different clubs and leagues.
Reporting and Visualization: Present the findings through comprehensive reports and visualizations to facilitate better understanding and decision-making. By the end of this project, we aim to have a fully functional SQL database capable of providing in-depth analysis of football players' data, offering valuable insights for stakeholders such as team managers, scouts, and analysts

**Technology used:** 
SQL server
